# Information and scopes
## Information
The following  materials are used for hands-on activities in undergraduate IoT class at the Biomedical Engineering, Telkom University, Bandung.

## Scopes
There are many MQTT client implementations for Arduino. Here, we will -- as much as possible -- use [PubSubClient](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/) by Nick O'Leary.
We will also stick to the the unencrypted-unauthenticated type of connection as much as possible, except for some cloud-based brokers that strictly require encryption and authentication.
